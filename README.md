In recent years, global economies have undergone dynamic changes, increasingly embracing innovations that redefine finance and transactional systems. This bachelor's thesis focuses on one such innovation: Bitcoin (BTC) — the first cryptocurrency, which emerged in the late 2000s and quickly evolved from a niche digital asset into a globally recognized investment vehicle.

The primary aim of this thesis is to assess whether Bitcoin fulfills the three fundamental functions of money — medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value — and whether it can be considered a viable alternative to traditional fiat currencies like the US dollar or euro.

Through an analysis of Bitcoin’s price movements from 2012 to 2020 and its technological underpinnings, the paper evaluates BTC’s monetary potential. The discussion compares the characteristics of the current fiat-based monetary system with Bitcoin, highlighting both similarities and critical differences.

The research is divided into two main chapters. The first outlines monetary theory, the core features of fiat currency, and the principles behind Bitcoin and blockchain. The second chapter analyzes BTC’s real-world performance in relation to the core monetary functions.

The study is based on both domestic and international literature, including academic research, institutional reports, and market data, offering a comprehensive view of Bitcoin’s position in the evolving financial landscape.
